# Paradigms

Let's talk about two representative paradigms: neural network and explicit coding.

# Interchangeability

Some argues that the source of intelligence comes from the structure of neural network. This is not correct because neural networks do not differ from ordinary computer programs in terms of what they can do. They are both Turing complete.

A neural network can be simulated by a computer program, and a computer program can also be simulated using a neural network. The latter may not be obvious, but as mentioned earlier, multiple layers of neural network can form logic gates, and with logic gates we can build a computer. Therefore, neural network and explicit coding are interchangeable in theory.

# Difference

Although the two paradigms are interchangeable in theory, they are not easily interchangeable in practice. For example, it is tedious to code explicit logic with neural network, and it is also tedious to implement fuzzy algorithms like image recognition using explicit coding.
