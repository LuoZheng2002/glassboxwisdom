Beware of the Illusion of "Oracle"

# Can intellgience be unified?
As we all know, human beings are capable of different activities, for example, do math problems, do sports, recognize 3D object and manufacture products. If we attempt to find a unified algorithm to solve these problems all at once, we need to first unify the definition of these activities. For example, we can unify the activites of playing chess, Go game and tic tac toe into the activity of playing board games.

So, what's the ultimate unification of all human activities? It is hard to come up with at first glance, since playing sports and doing math problems are by no means in the same category. However, we can still describe them both as receiving visual or verbal inputs and outputing muscle movements (since answering math problems involves writing them down). You may ask, what if I want only digital input and digital output? It is simple if you are crazy enough: we can let the AI robot sit in front of a laptop, let the laptop transform digital data into images on the screen, and let the robot hit the keybord to generate digital data. Bam! Easy Turing reduction.

At this point, our intuition begins to fight agains logical reasoning, because obviously, letting a robot to sit in front of a laptop sounds like "taking off trousers and fart", since AIs are supposed to be better at digital jobs than interacting with real world. This is absolutely correct. The point is, we may totally underestimate the power of such an "oracle" that transforms input into output.

// such oracle does not exist, 


This is background chapter 2.

// general intelligence

// unified algorithm vs. multiple specific algorithms
unified: also unify the description of problems

not obvious, but human brains to some extent look like a unified system

// specific algorithms: coupled vs. decoupled

// tradeoff among three: flexibility, developer friendly (feasibility), maintainable

symbolism: controllable, complicated, detailed
